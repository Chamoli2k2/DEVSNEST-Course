Question 1 : 

You are given a String str. Return the String by Concatenating it with String "Hello, " and an exclamation mark at the end “!”.

Input Format
First Parameter - String str

Output Format
Return a String s

Example 1:
Input:
    "Mac"
Output:
    "Hello, Mac!"
Explanation:
    Given a String, Mac is Concatenated with string "Hello, " at the beginning and "!" at the end
Constraints
1 <= length of string <= 20
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

solution :

string solve(string str){
    str = "Hello, " + str + "!";
    return str;
}

Question 2 :

You are given two integers, a and b.
Compute the Sum and Difference of a and b. Return the Product of Sum and Difference.

Input Format
First Parameter - Integer a

Second Parameter - Integer b

Output Format
Return the integer.

Example 1:
Input:
    5
    2
Output:
    21
Explanation:
    Sum is (5 + 2)  = 7 and Difference is (5 - 2) = 3. The product of Sum and Difference is 21.
Example 2:
Input:
    -14
    -4
Output:
    180
Explanation:
    The Sum is -18 and Difference is -10. The product is 180.
Constraints
-104 <= a, b <= 104
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Solution :

int solve(int a, int b){
    int num1 = a + b;
    int num2 = a - b;
    return num1*num2;
}

Question 3 : 

You are given two integers, a and b.

Let x be the integer division and y be the decimal(float) division of a and b.

Return the product of x and y.

Input Format
First Parameter - Integer a

Second Parameter - Integer b

Output Format
Return the decimal product of integer division x and decimal division y of a and b.

Example 1:
Input:
    21
    5
Output:
    16.8
Explanation:
    The int and float value of 21 / 5 is 4 and 4.2 respectively. The product is 16.8
Example 2:
Input:
    11
    4
Output:
    5.5
Explanation:
    The integer and float value of (11 / 4) is 2 and 2.75 respectively. The product is 5.5
Constraints
Range of a and b is [-104, 104] except 0.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Solution : 

float solve(int a, int b){
    float num1 = float(a)/float(b);
    float num2 = a/b;
    return num1*num2;
}
